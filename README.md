# Asynchronous Database Connectivity in Java

This is a project I created for my (thesis)[http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3386&context=etd]
at (Brigham Young University)[http://byu.edu]. There are four maincomponents to this project:

# A database agnostic API (conceptually similar to JDBC) for asynchronous/non-blocking relational database interaction.
# A MySQL native implemention of the API
# A Postgresql native implementation of the API
# An API implementation that uses JDBC and and a thread-pool for asynchrony.

These database drivers are not production worthy.
